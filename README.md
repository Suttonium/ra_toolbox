# RA Toolbox

The data for residence life is currently stored in numerous google sheets, forms, and docs. This data is manually transferred from application to application and can cause inaccuracy when it comes to roster verifications, student security information, and room availability throughout campus. As a result of this confusion, RA toolbox is designed to centralize all of this data into one, unified database and will allow hall directors, resident assistants, and students to view a live update on information that pertains to their roles on campus. Hall directors will be able to view rosters for their building as well as view the student trackers maintained by their individual resident assistant staff members. Resident Assistants will be able to view their individual student rosters and maintain their trackers throughout the semester, and students and resident assistants alike will be able to view / update their student security information. 

## General Workflow
The system grants resident assistants and students the ability to sign up, designating which type of user they are (RA or student). If an RA attemppts to sign up, the hall director for the building is emailed a verification email to assure non-resident assistant students cannot signup as RAs.
