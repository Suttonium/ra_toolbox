            RA Toolbox is designed to simplify the lives of Hall Directors, Resident Assistants, and Students
            simultaneously. Hall Directors will be able to view their RA Roster along with their RA's individual
            rosters. They will also have the ability to view the roster for the entirety of the university.
            RAs will be able to view their rosters and the associated student trackers they must monitor
            throughout the semester. Front Desk Assistants will be able to utilize the newly designed desk accounts
            in order to simplify the job and prevent data manipulation. Every Student will be able to
            view and update their Student Information Cards allowing them to be in full control of their personal
            information.
